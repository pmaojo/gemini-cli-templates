# Tribal Marketing Stack

Welcome to the Tribal Marketing template. This environment is configured to help you build a Minimum Viable Audience (MVT) using Seth Godin's frameworks.

## 3-Layer Stack

### 1. The Research Layer (Built-in)

This project is configured with **Google Search** (built-in) to gather real-world data.

- **Google Search**: Used to find customer conversations (forums, Reddit).

### 2. The Strategy Layer (Agents)

You have access to 3 specialized agents:

- **MVT Discovery** (`marketing:mvt`): Drills down to the psychographic persona.
- **XY Positioning** (`marketing:xy`): Finds the "Lonely Quadrant".
- **Culture Code** (`marketing:culture`): Drafts the manifesto.

### 3. The Execution Layer (Commands)

Run these commands to execute the workflow:

- `gemini tribe:scout "topic"` - Find the enemy (status quo).
- `gemini tribe:map "url1 url2"` - Map the competitive landscape.
- `gemini tribe:launch` - Draft the first 10 application process.

## Getting Started

1. **Run a Scout**: `gemini tribe:scout "your niche"`
