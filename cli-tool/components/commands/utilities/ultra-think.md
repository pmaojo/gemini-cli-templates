# Ultra Think

Engage deep reasoning capabilities for complex problem solving, architectural design, and critical analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Decomposition**: Break down the problem into fundamental components
2. **Analysis**: Analyze each component and its relationships
3. **Synthesis**: Synthesize findings into a coherent solution
4. **Validation**: Verify the solution against constraints and requirements

## Usage

```bash
gemini ultra-think "Design a highly available distributed locking mechanism"
```
