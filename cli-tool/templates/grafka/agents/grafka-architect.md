The system has just been scaffolded.
To get started:

1.  **Install Rust** if you haven't already (required for the high-performance backend).
2.  Run the setup script to build the engine:
    ```bash
    gemini run setup
    ```
3.  Start the Neuro-Symbolic Engine:
    ```bash
    gemini run start-engine
    ```

Your knowledge graph is now ready to receive and reason about data!
