## Stack

- **Frontend**: React/Vite (or similar modern framework)
- **MCP Integration**: Includes `kthulu-go` MCP for stack management.

## Quick Start

   ```bash
   gemini run setup
   ```
2. **Run**:

   gemini run dev
   ```

## Architecture

The project is structured to support scalability and maintainability, with a clear separation between the Go API and the frontend client.
